# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** February 2026

Onepilot ("we", "our") respects your privacy. This policy describes what data the Onepilot app uses and how we handle it.

## Data we use

- **Server connections:** The app connects to coding agent servers on your local network, via Tailscale, or over SSH. Connection details (hostnames, IP addresses) are stored locally on your device to remember your servers. This data is never sent to us or any third party.
- **SSH credentials:** If you connect to a remote server via SSH, your credentials (username, password or private key) are used only for the duration of the connection and are not persisted or transmitted outside the SSH session.
- **Conversations:** All conversation data (messages, code, files) is exchanged directly between your device and the coding agent server you connect to. We do not have access to, collect, or store any conversation content.
- **Photos:** If you attach a photo from your camera or library, it is sent directly to the connected coding agent server. We do not collect or store your photos.
- **API keys:** If you authenticate with an API key, it is sent directly to the connected server. We do not collect or store your API keys.

## Data we do not collect

We do not collect analytics, telemetry, crash reports, location data, device identifiers, or any personally identifiable information. We do not use any third-party tracking or advertising SDKs. The app does not communicate with any server operated by us.

## Data stored on your device

The app uses local storage (UserDefaults) to remember your saved server list. This data stays on your device and is not synced or backed up to any external service beyond standard iCloud device backups configured by you.

## Third-party services

- **Apple:** The app is distributed through the App Store. Apple may collect data as described in Apple's own privacy policy.
- **Coding agent servers:** When you connect to a server, data is exchanged directly with that server. The privacy practices of that server depend on its operator and configuration.

We do not use any other third-party services, SDKs, or analytics tools.

## Retention and deletion

All app data is stored locally on your device. Uninstalling the app removes all locally stored data. We have no data to retain or delete on our end.

## Your rights

Since we do not collect any personal data, there is no personal data held by us to access, correct, or delete. For questions about this policy, contact us at the email below.
